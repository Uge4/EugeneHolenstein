#Hello :wave: :earth_asia:

Thanks for flying :airplane: by my github page.<br>
<br>
I'm Eugene, an entrepreneurial <strong>Product Manager/Owner</strong> with an interest in software development, emerging technologies and innovation.<br>
<br>
Developing innovative digital products and experiences that solve real-world customer problems is super rewarding. While design-thinking plays are critical at the start of this process for customers, a big part of creating value for businesses rests in the technology production process and end-product/solution. After having worked with great technology teams on everything from cloud platforms to ecommerce and augmented reality platforms, I've developed a deep appreciation and interest in software development and believe this is beneficial to delivering high-quality, scalable and innovative products and solutions in my role.<br>
<br>
As an entrepreneurially minded innovator, the opportunities that emerging technologies present makes it an exciting time to be creating digital products, so maybe fly by again in future and see what ive been up to :wink: <br>
