#Hello :wave: :earth_asia:

Thanks for flying :airplane: by my github page.<br>
<br>
I'm Eugene, an entrepreneurial <strong>Product Manager/Owner</strong> with an interest in software development, emerging technologies and innovation.<br>
<br>
I love developing innovative digital products and experiences that solve real-world customer problems.<br>
<br>
While design-thinking plays are critical role in the process for customers, a big part of creating value for businesses rests in the technology production process and end-product/solution (and it's associated tech-debt). After having worked with great technology teams on everything from cloud data analytics platforms to ecommerce sites and apps, and augmented reality platforms, I've developed a deep appreciation and interest in technology and software development, and am actively upskilling to be able to better communicate and contriute in these processes. I believe this extra insight is going to be beneficial in my role delivering high-quality, scalable and innovative products and solutions and will allow me to drive technology innovation initiatives and projects.<br>
<br>
Finally, as an entrepreneurially minded person, I think the opportunities that emerging technologies such as Generative AI, AIOT and Web3.0  makes it a super exciting time to be working in digital product development, so maybe fly by again in future because you never know what I might be up to :wink: <br>
