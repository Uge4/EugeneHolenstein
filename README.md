#Hello :wave: :earth_asia:

Thanks for flying :airplane: by my github page!<br>
<br>
I'm Eugene, a <strong>Product Manager</strong> by day and <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> by night 🌃🌙💻🕯️ <br>
<br>
As someone that lives and breathes product development, I think understanding how software is built and the processes and methods underpinning it, is important to delivering high quality and scalable products and solutions.

From designing intuitive user experiences in SaaS platforms to developing digital experiences, it's all about solving customer problems and delighting users - all of which can be done a number of ways but you first have to be able to ask the righ questions and have the right conversations!<br>
<br>
As an entrepreneurially minded innovator, the opportunities that emerging technologies present makes it an exciting time to be creating digital products, so maybe fly by again in future and see what ive been up to :wink: <br>
