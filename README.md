#Hello :wave: :earth_asia:

Thanks for flying :airplane: by my github page!<br>
<br>
I'm Eugene, a <strong>Product Manager</strong> by day and <strong>Full Stack Developer</strong> by night 🌃🌙💻🕯️ <br>
<br>
As someone that lives and breathes product development, understanding how to build software that's scalable and extensible is super important to me.
From designing to developing digital experiences, it's all about solving painpoints and delighting users which can be done in any number of ways - you just need to be able to have the right conversations!<br>
<br>
More to the point, as an entrepreneurially minded innovator, the opportunities that emerging technologies present just makes it an exciting time to be creating digital products. <br>
